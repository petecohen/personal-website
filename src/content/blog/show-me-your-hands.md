I started playing piano at 7, taught by my aunty. Then at 11, I was walking down the hallway at school and was commanded to put out my hands. I was summarily told I'd be playing double bass (even though I didn't know what it was).

That moment of the double bass finding me is a recurring theme of my musical journey. More than just a calling, it feels more like a destiny. A winding and enduring path, with more pull than push.

## Early Days

The double bass became my instrument through that chance encounter at school. What started as a command became a passion. I learned to love the physicality of it, the way it anchored the music, the responsibility of holding down the low end.

Through high school and beyond, I played in orchestras and small ensembles, but I was always drawn to contemporary music. I wanted to be in bands, to write songs, to tour.

## Sodastream: The Foundation

In 1997, everything changed. Karl Smith and I started Sodastream, and for the next 27 years, it became the centre of my musical life. We weren't trying to be anything other than ourselves - two friends making music together, figuring it out as we went.

We released our first album *Enjoy* in 1997, and somehow it connected with people. We toured internationally - the UK, Europe, Japan. We released album after album: *Practical Footwear*, *Looks Like A Russian*, *The Hill For Company*, *A Minor Revival*, *Reservations*, *Little By Little*, and finally *Letter From Melbourne* in 2020.

The band evolved over time. We went from a full lineup to just the two of us, Karl and me. The sound changed, became more intimate, more focused. But the core of what we were doing remained the same - honest songs, carefully crafted, played with love.

## The Wider World

Alongside Sodastream, I played with so many other artists. Architecture in Helsinki during their breakthrough years. Machine Translations, where I found kindred spirits in experimental pop. The Lucksmiths, whose gentle jangle pop was the perfect counterpoint to Sodastream's intensity.

I played on records by Clare Bowditch, Luluc, Because of Ghosts, Mountains in the Sky. Each project taught me something new about collaboration, about serving the song, about listening.

There were side projects too - Khancoban, Lee Memorial, the RPM Trio, The Best Friends Group. Each one a different facet of what music could be, a different way of thinking about bass, melody, and structure.

## Smith & Cohen: The Next Chapter

By 2024, Sodastream had run its course. Not because we'd fallen out or lost interest, but because it was time. We'd said what we needed to say under that name.

So we became Smith & Cohen. Same partnership, new name. And in 2025, we released *Half Life* - an album that feels like both an ending and a beginning. All the experience of the previous decades distilled into something clearer, more focused.

The album title says it all really. Half life. The idea that even as things decay and transform, there's still energy, still momentum. We're not done yet.

## The Double Bass Still Finds Me

Looking back now, I can see that the double bass chose me, not the other way around. Every time I've tried to step away, to focus on other things, it pulls me back. Karl and I have been playing together for nearly three decades now, and I still feel that same pull - the destiny of it all.

I think about that moment in the hallway at age 11, being told to show my hands. How could I have known that single moment would set the course for my entire adult life? How could anyone?

Music has taught me about patience, about persistence, about the value of long partnerships. It's taught me that success isn't always measured in charts or sales, but in the quiet satisfaction of making something you believe in and finding the people who believe in it too.

I hope this account of my musical journey is only half done, and that there are many more chapters to add.
