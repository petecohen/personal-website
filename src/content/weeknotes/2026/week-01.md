A new year, and seeking to start weeknotes as a new habit.

Enjoyed an extended version of that liminal week between Christmas and New Year.

## Work & Projects

Started the week in a park with my Vibrance colleague Fred, musing about the year ahead. We landed on a recognition of a need to somehow create experiences for people where they can deeply think together about the implications of everything that is emerging around us.

Having just finished up after a few years at RMIT, lots of new work kicking off in my portfolio:
- An assessment of a financial services firm with the Conversational Design Institute
- A new and ambitious sprint with an Indian mobility client with Boundaryless
- Chatting to a startup about a fractional CTO role

Ramping up with my professional services firm client with Vibrance. Lots of great progress made last year building AI proof of concepts, and now preparing to start pilots with customers. Exciting times.

## Reading

Finished reading *Trust* by Hernán Díaz. Rare for me to read fiction, but I enjoyed it.

## Life

Chasing kittens around the house!
