## Why Weeknotes?

I've been thinking about starting a regular writing practice for a while. Weeknotes seem like the perfect format - low pressure, personal, and focused on reflection rather than perfect prose.

## What I've Learned

From exploring existing weeknotes sites, I've noticed a few patterns:

- **Consistency matters more than perfection** - Alice Bartlett calls hers "weaknotes" because they're "quite bad," but she's written 382+ of them
- **There's no single format** - Some people use bullet points, others write narratives
- **Mix work and personal** - The best weeknotes blend professional updates with personal reflections
- **Keep it sustainable** - Simple formats last longer than elaborate ones

## My Approach

I'm going to keep it simple:
- Write on Sunday evenings
- Use flexible sections (highlights, work, reading, links)
- No pressure to cover everything
- Allow the format to evolve

Let's see how this goes!
