## Westwood & Kawakubo

My daughter enthusiastically insisted we go as a family to see the [Vivienne Westwood and Rei Kawakubo exhibition](https://www.ngv.vic.gov.au/labels/westwood-kawakubo-timeline/) at NGV. It has been put together really well, and the way their parallel stories and work has been presented gives it more depth. They were both born around the same time as my mum, and they both rose to prominence in the late 1970s when I was born - which somehow made all the story telling more relatable. The walls were plastered with quotes, which bought everything they expressed through their fashion designs to life.

## Give Water To Birds

I looked up a local band called Zoj who I saw a few years back playing a live accompaniment to an incredible silent documentary called Grass, that follows a branch of the Bakhtiari tribe of Lurs in Persia as they and their herds make their seasonal journey to better pastures. Zoj's new album is called [Give Water To Birds](https://zojduet.bandcamp.com/album/give-water-to-birds), which is something I have been doing lately. I saw the local magpies making use of a tub I put out for them. All feels connected somehow.

## Lex

It was great to meet [Nathan Baschez](https://twitter.com/nbashaw) on a call. I have been following his work since the early days of [Every](https://every.to), and I am a happy user of his product [Lex](https://lex.page) - which is like a proper AI enabled long form writing environment. I knew he was working on something else and was a bit nervous that it spelt the end of Lex, but having now seen it, it feels like an evolution. I'm grateful to have been given a preview sneak peak at the new product, and its amazing to see what a solo developer can achieve these days.

## Sicilian Orange Salad

Enjoyed celebrating my friend Fred's birthday at one of his great BBQ's and I continued in the tradition of taking my Nonna's Sicilian orange salad. Like any simple dish, there is a lot of nuance to it. I remember that my Nonna used to literally measure salt with handfuls, and I need to build up the confidence to do the same to really recreate the dish true to its original form.
