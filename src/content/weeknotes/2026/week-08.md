summary: "A Melbourne Sunday: breakdancing, synthesisers at MESS, and an Afro-Caribbean festival at Fed Square"
---

I never really need reminding why I love living in Melbourne, but this weekend reinforced the point. My daughter found a breakdance competition that was happening, so we went along and watched a bunch of kids competing. What struck me was that it was a really positive vibe, and although there was the expected bravado and attitude that you'd expect at a competition, it all felt really good-natured and there was a lot of love in the room.

Just outside where the dance competition was happening, I was delighted to find the new home of [MESS](https://mess.foundation/), which is the Melbourne Electronic Sound Studio. I was only able to look through the window and take a few photos of the old synthesisers on display. I'm feeling very inspired to go in and have a session there to play with toys and make some sounds.

And then outside at Federation Square, there was an Afro-Caribbean festival and a huge sound system being set up with dub beats, which I am oddly partial to. And again, lots of people dancing and having a great time.

So amazing to be able to just stumble across this stuff by accident on a Sunday afternoon, all within metres of each other.
