**[Internet Phonebook](https://internetphonebook.net/)** - I've been enjoying dipping into this (physical) book that I got through a group buy that Anthony Agius organised. Its modelled on a old school phonebook, and is full of interesting and quirky people and websites. Any random entry on any page is sure to send you down a long and wonderful rabbithole - such as perusing the many websites made by [Laurel Schwulst](https://laurelschwulst.com/today/#bio) - who is interested in ambient forms of design and literature, public works, and the poetic potential of the world wide web.

**Kitty Feeder** - I'm yet another person enthused about Claude Code. It is helping me clear my backlog of ideas and projects. One was redoing my personal website, which I designed in collaboration with CC and continue to deploy changes (such as these very Weeknotes) - like it is a CMS, not just a coder. Anyway, another project I have had on my list for over two years is to make use of a Seeed Studio SenseCAP Indicator D1 device that I bought along with my Home Assistant Yellow. I've tried a couple of times in the past, but it was all a bit daunting. This week, I had a great use case - which was to create an app to help us track how much the kittens have been fed throughout the day. Only took an hour or two. The colours aren't stable for some reason, but it seems to work, and should be genuinely useful.

**Uniqlo tshirts** - my 11 year old daughter is very creative and entrepreneurial. She has created a bunch of drawings of "bed bugs" characters and has been creating merch. The first idea was a humble zine (to hopefully sell through the super cool [Sticky Institute](https://stickyinstitute.com)). Then we stumbled across a new service at Uniqlo Melbourne where they will print designs onto shirts and tote bags for you within an hour. So needless to say, we have been in there a bunch of times this week creating items for family members and she has ambitions to test the market.

**M1 Meshcore** - The [radio units](https://atlavox.com/products/atlavox-m1) that my friend Daryl and I ordered arrived, and I got to fire mine up for the first time. I've had a long interest in radio, but not always the best luck/focus to get a tonne of traction. So far, yet to make any contacts. But we got them for what we half jokingly refer to as "SHTF" - i.e. when the world gots off the rails and shit hits the fan, at which point the telephony network and internet won't be working. The idea of these devices is that they don't rely on those kind of networks, but rather create a peer to peer mesh. I hope we never need it, but I also hope I can get it working convincingly soon.

**Index 01** - When I first saw [this](https://repebble.com/index) I was immediately interested. It is a ring that lets you speak in short notes and commands, which are then stored or processed as appropriate. I have many thoughts throughout the day that I would like to capture, so I'm interested to see how this ring helps. I can see how it will be much more efficient than pulling out the phone or trying to trigger a shortcut on the Apple Watch. Daryl 3D printed me some test rings so I could work out which size is right for me, and I have put in the pre-order. It has been exciting to see the reports coming in from CES from people who are interacting with the prototypes. Hopefully they ship soon!
